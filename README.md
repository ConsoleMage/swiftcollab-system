# data-structures-and-algorithms-project

This is the peer-graded assignment for "Data Structures and Algorithms," the tenth course in a 12-course series in the Microsoft Full-Stack Developer Professional Certificate program.

For this project, you will submit your optimized and debugged implementations for several key algorithms. Throughout the previous four activities, you refined a binary tree structure, improved a task scheduling system, optimized sorting performance, and debugged task execution logic using Microsoft Copilot. This submission consolidates all your work for review and feedback.

## Introduction

SwiftCollab, a growing collaboration and workflow automation platform, helps teams manage tasks and projects. As the platform scales, the task assignment system has experienced slow performance, making it difficult to retrieve and assign tasks efficiently.

The engineering team has identified that the binary tree data structure used for task prioritization is inefficient and needs optimization. You have been assigned to analyze and refine the binary tree implementation, ensuring faster task retrieval and processing.

To assist in this optimization, you will use an LLM to suggest improvements, ensuring the code is efficient, scalable, and meets performance expectations.
