# swiftcollab-system

This is the peer-graded assignment for "Data Structures and Algorithms," the tenth course in a 12-course series in the Microsoft Full-Stack Developer Professional Certificate program.

AI-assisted development tools like Microsoft Copilot can streamline the implementation and optimization of complex algorithms. This module explores how Copilot enhances back-end efficiency by assisting in writing and optimizing data structures and algorithms in .NET Core. Learners will use Copilot to implement advanced algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path and A* search, analyze AI-generated code for performance improvements, and complete a comprehensive optimization project. By leveraging Copilot, developers can refine their approach to algorithmic design and scalability.

## Introduction

SwiftCollab, a growing collaboration and workflow automation platform, helps teams manage tasks and projects. As the platform scales, the task assignment system has experienced slow performance, making it difficult to retrieve and assign tasks efficiently.

The engineering team has identified that the binary tree data structure used for task prioritization is inefficient and needs optimization. You have been assigned to analyze and refine the binary tree implementation, ensuring faster task retrieval and processing.

To assist in this optimization, you will use an LLM to suggest improvements, ensuring the code is efficient, scalable, and meets performance expectations.
